# Custom-FDM-3D-Printer

This is a large scale FDM 3D printer that I have built completely from scratch. The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive open-source design, enabling anyone to construct their own large-scale 3D printer of any size.
STL Files and documentation will be provided soon.
